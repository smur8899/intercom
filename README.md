## What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.
 - I'm proud of my achievements as Scrum Master on my current team, having taken over the role recently. With my guidance and help, the team have been able to turn around from being an underperforming team widely seen as the 'problem child' team to the most predictable and visible team in the company, with an already emerging steady velocity (after 3 two-week sprints). Each team member is more aware of, and involved in each others work than ever before, myself included, and I would hope that we soon start to enter the 'performing' stage of Tuckman's group development stages. I'm proud of the role I played in my team's turn around, and I have personally been asked to coach Scrum Masters from the other teams due to our success.
 - On a more technical note, I'm also proud of the steps we've been taking towards code quality for the entire department. This work has been ongoing over the past number of months, championed by a few members of the dev team, myself included. Most recently, I took on adding code coverage to our build process. In an attempt to increase coverage, I implemented a build fail rule so that no Pull Request can be merged if it reduces the coverage, resulting in an increase of coverage from ~12% to 29.5% currently. When I joined the company first, we had no CI process whatsoever. 
   
## Write a function that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] â†’ [1,2,3,4]. If the language you're using has a function to flatten arrays, you should pretend it doesn't exist.

## We have some customer records in a text file (customers.json) -- one customer per line, JSON-encoded. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).
